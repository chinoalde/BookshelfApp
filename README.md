# Chino's Personal Project

## Bookshelf App

### Project Proposal

***Q**: What will this app do?*  
**A**: This app will allow users to keep track of books they have read,
categorize them, and rate them on a scale out of 10.  

***Q**: Who will use this app?*  
**A**: There are millions of books out in the world that some may read
over a span of several years. This app aims at users who want a simple way
to view the books they've read or want to read, be able to leave a rating/review, and sort through them.  

***Q**: Why am I interested in this project?*  
**A**: Over the past year, a new hobby that I have picked is reading books and manga (Japanese comics).
Books provide a gateway to experience someone else's story or be immersed in a new world, where you can
learn new ideas and concepts, while expanding your world view. Keeping track of the books
will allow individuals to keep track of their bookshelf, and allow peers to see each other's bookshelves.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to **ADD new book entries** to my *bookshelf*.
- As a user, I want to be able to **VIEW the list of books** in my *bookshelf*.
- As a user, I want to be able to **MARK a book as read** in my *bookshelf*.
- As a user, I want to be able to **REMOVE a book** from my *bookshelf*.
- As a user, I want to be able to **SAVE the *bookshelf*** to a file.
- As a user, I want to be able to **LOAD my *bookshelf*** from a file

### Instructions for Grader
1. Load saved data by pressing yes when prompted by clicking the start button.
2. add a new book entry to the bookshelf by clicking the "add new book" button and filling in the book's information.
3. Once done adding books, click the save file button at the bottom left of the application.
4. After saving, click quit and then "yes" when prompted to override saved data.

load saved data.

### Phase 4: Task 2

Sun Apr 02 23:15:45 PDT 2023
Loaded book Think Like a Monk to list.

Sun Apr 02 23:16:27 PDT 2023
Added book Letters from a Stoic to list.

Sun Apr 02 23:16:43 PDT 2023
Added book CPSC 210 to list.

### Phase 4: Task 3
- I would find a way to let external classes access and modify fields in the GUI class, which would get of the 3
"extends" relationships for AddBookPanel, HomePagePanel, and StartUpPanel
- I would add more helper methods in the larger classes so the code is more readable
- I would implement an observer design pattern whenever I add/delete a book instead of manually refreshing the book lists
every time something happens.
