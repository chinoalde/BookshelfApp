# Chino's Personal Project

## Bookshelf App

### Project Proposal

***Q**: What will this app do?*  
**A**: This app will allow users to keep track of books they have read,
categorize them, and rate them on a scale out of 10.  

***Q**: Who will use this app?*  
**A**: There are millions of books out in the world that some may read
over a span of several years. This app aims at users who want a simple way
to view the books they've read or want to read, be able to leave a rating/review, and sort through them.  

***Q**: Why am I interested in this project?*  
**A**: Over the past year, a new hobby that I have picked is reading books and manga (Japanese comics).
Books provide a gateway to experience someone else's story or be immersed in a new world, where you can
learn new ideas and concepts, while expanding your world view. Keeping track of the books
will allow individuals to keep track of their bookshelf, and allow peers to see each other's bookshelves.
